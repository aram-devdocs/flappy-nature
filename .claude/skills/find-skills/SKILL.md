# /find-skills

Discover all available skills, agents, and rules configured for this project.

## Trigger

User invokes `/find-skills` optionally with a filter keyword.

## What This Skill Does

Scans the `.claude/` directory tree and reports what is available.

## Process

1. List all files in `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` -- these are skills (slash commands).
2. List all files in `.claude/agents/*.md` -- these are dispatchable agents.
3. List all files in `.claude/rules/*.md` -- these are enforcement rules.
4. Read the root `CLAUDE.md` for the skills/agents/TDD summary tables.
5. Read each `packages/*/CLAUDE.md` for package-specific guidance.
